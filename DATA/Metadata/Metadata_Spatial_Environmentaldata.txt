## Description: 
Spatial field survey in august 2023, were macrophyte material was destructively harvested at 20 sites along in the Pojo_Hanko archipelago, Finland.   
Salinity data was collected during site scouting and sediment characteristics were analyzed using TGA701 Thermo-gravimetric Analyzer for LOI and a particle size analyzer for the sand and clay fraction

## Metadata are in the form of: # Variable - description with units

# Variable list:

# Site - Site number combined with exposure category
