## Description: 
Seasonal field survey, based on four sampling campaigns (October 2021, March 2022, June 2022 and August 2022) of destructively harvesting macrophyte material in the Tvärminne archipelago, Finland.  
Carbohydrate analyses were conducted on a subset of samples collected during the four field surveys. For every species, up to 10 samples for each tissue compartement (i.e. leaf and rhizome) during each survey.
Dried tissue was homogenized using  sterile stainless-steel beads and a ball mill (Retsch MM 400). Samples were micro-weighed by hand and analyzed following an acid-based method by Landhäusser et al. (2018). 
This method quantified the total amount of soluble sugars (i.e., mono- and oligosaccharides) and starch present in the samples.

## Metadata are in the form of: # Variable - description with units

# Variable list:

# Species - Six letter code of the species. Codes are as follows: MYRSPI - Myriophyllum spicatum, CERDEM - Ceratophyllum demersum, POTPER - Potamogeton perfoliatus, RANBAU - Ranunculus baudotii, RANCIR - Ranunculus circinatus, RUPCIR - Ruppia cirhos, STUPEC - Stuckenia pectinata, ZANMAJ - Zannichelia major, ZOSMAR - Zoster Marina 
# Tissue - Tissue compartement used for elemental analyses (leaf or rhizome)
# Carbohydrate - The differen carbohydrate compounds: Soluble (i.e. soluble sugars) and starch 
# Time - Timing of the data collection (March, June, August, October)
# Amount (mg/g) - The amount of carbohydrate per dry weight of the sampled tissue in mg/g
# Boxplot - Factor for plotting Carbohydrates
