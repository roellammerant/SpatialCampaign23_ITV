## Description: 
Seasonal field survey, based on four sampling campaigns (October 2021, March 2022, June 2022 and August 2022) of destructively harvesting macrophyte material in the Tv√§rminne archipelago, Finland.    
Data were collected through the use of high precision scales, a flatbed scanner, WinRHIZO and imageJ (Rueden et al. 2017)

## Metadata are in the form of: # Variable - description with units

# Variable list:

# Tab mixed:

# Site - The site number from where macrophyte material was destructively harvested (M_N_1, M_N_2, M_N_3, M_S_1, M_S_2, M_S_3) and the number of the collected quadrat (1-4).
# Species - Six letter code of the species. Codes are as follows: MYRSPI - Myriophyllum spicatum, CERDEM - Ceratophyllum demersum, POTPER - Potamogeton perfoliatus, RANBAU - Ranunculus baudotii, RANCIR - Ranunculus circinatus, RUPCIR - Ruppia cirhos, STUPEC - Stuckenia pectinata, ZANMAJ - Zannichelia major, ZOSMAR - Zoster Marina
