## Description: 
Spatial field survey in august 2023, were macrophyte material was destructively harvested at 20 sites along in the Pojo_Hanko archipelago, Finland.  
Elemental analyses were conducted on a subset of individuals, for up to four indivudals of each species per site.
Dried tissue was homogenized using sterile stainless-steel beads and a ball mill (Retsch MM 400). 
Samples were micro-weighed by hand and nalyzed using a Sercon Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer at Tvärminne Zoological Staion.

## Metadata are in the form of: # Variable - description with units

# Abbreviation - Abbreviation for samples in the well plate with site, species and tissue information
# Exposure - Exposure categories, consisting of Exposed, Semi, Sheltered and Pojo
# Organism - Origin of macrophyte material (Algae or Plant)
# Species - Abbreviations for the collected species
# Tissue - Tissue used for elemental analyses
# dwt(mg) - Dry weight of the sample used for elemental analyses in mg
# N (µg) - Amount of particulate organic nitrogen in µg
# δ15N - Nitrogen stable isotope measurement
# C (µg) - Amount of particulate organic carbon in µg
